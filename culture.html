            <h1>Gong Culture</h1>
            <p class="text" style="text-align: justify;">In earlier times before phones, the gong was more than just a musical instrument. Gong was used as a communication tool to indicate to other villagers up to five kilometres distant in addition to conveying happiness and despair. The rhythm allows the listeners to determine if the news is positive or bad. A slow beat indicates a drink invitation. A rapid rhythm suggests danger. When someone is dying, the heartbeats begin slowly at first, pick up quickly, and then slow back down once the person has passed away.Owning gong was once highly prized and was considered a symbol of riches. Villagers would trade livestock for gongs, which are frequently found in dowries. Gong's age and tone determine its worth.People from that era can identify each gong's distinctive sound and even detect flaws in a gong. Therefore, gong theft is uncommon because the owner (and other villagers) will always find their gong once it has been stolen. </p>
