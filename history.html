        <p><b><em>After the British North Borneo Chartered Company leased the territory of Sabah from the sultans of Brunei 
            and Sulu in 1882, Kudat was established as the first capital of Sabah. Kudat is known as the tip of Borneo because 
            it is located in the upper north of the Malaysian state of Sabah. Before the entrance of the British colonialists, 
            kudat was given the name “Tomborungan” by the local and native Rungus community, and the name was given in conjunction 
            with the Tomborungan River that no longer flows at this time. (Ria Hotel. Kudat. Sabah: Kudat Attractions, 2018) The Rungus 
            believed the British were interested in identifying the coarse grass growing there when they came and inquired about the location's 
            name, so they said that the name was Kudad. However, not long after that, the name was changed to Kudat and was used in preference to 
            the old name. (Kudat, 2023)The peoples of Borneo were influenced by the Chinese either directly or by trade through intermediaries.
            Antique Chinese ceramics are common. Contact with southern Indians is manifested in some linguistic cognates with Sanskrit, the most important being divato', the spirit familiar of the Rungus priestesses. 
            In the sixteenth century Muslim traders spread Islam along the coast of Borneo. </em> </b></p>
